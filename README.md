Griptape.js is an opinionated, web application front-end framework for developing dApps in Secret Network.

## Why Griptape?

Griptape is an essential part of the skate setup. Not only does it provide the traction necessary to keep your foot on the board, but it helps when doing advanced stuff like tricks, which is the real focus of most skaters.

While developing dApps, we found a lot of patterns and good practices that can help you quickly get your application up and running and start focusing on what your application has to do. We call it Griptape because it is the layer that helps with the core of your app--it helps you get off the ground.
