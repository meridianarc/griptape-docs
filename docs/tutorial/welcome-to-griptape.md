# Welcome to Griptape.js
And in fact, welcome to the first Griptape.js tutorial; one of many hopefully. 

## Brief Housekeeping
If you jumped here without taking a look at [Introductory](/) section, we admire your go-getter spirit, but it may be helpful to take a look at it first. It goes over the goals of Griptape.js, why we built it, and importantly, why we call it Griptape.js. It's truly awe inspiring.

## Who is this for?
Before we get going, it's important to know that this tutorial is for the Vue.js flavor of Griptape. A key part feature of Griptape is it's modular design which includes the idea of "flavors". Eventually we will have flavors like griptape-react and griptape-svelte, but of now we only have griptape-vue. If you think Vue.js is lame as F#*K, maybe this is your chance to actually try it and have your mind changed. If not it's your loss and you can GTF out!

Still here? Great, you will love it, we promise**. 

## What are we building?
The tutorial is broken into two parts.

### Part 1
In Part 1 we will get you familiar with the basics and let you try things out. We'll be honest, this will be a bit like Math class where you learn something and then find out there is a easier, faster, better way to do it. But just like in that class it will help provide background and insight. If you want to skip this section and just build an actual app we can't stop you.

### Part 2
In Part 2 we're going to build a Sealed-Bid Auctions App, just like [Secret Auctions](https://auctions.scrt.network). We won't build the entire app, at least not yet, but we will get pretty close. Although how close depends on how much of this we've finished. In part 2 we will sort of just be coding and explaining the purpose, but not so much explaining every little piece. Let us know if we strike a good balance.

## Lets GO!
Without any more blabber, lets get started!
