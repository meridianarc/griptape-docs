# Welcome Packet

**Welcome Hackers**

We are excited to welcome you all to the first Griptape Hackathon. This is a big milestone for us, one that we are thrilled to share with you. So, without further ado, let's begin.

**Schedule**

The hackathon four weeks long. Each week will follow the same schedule

`Monday: You Do You`

`Tuesday: 1PM-3PM: Live React Coding`

`Wed: 1PM - 3PM: Live Vue Coding`

`Thursday: 1PM - 3PM: Office Hours`

`Friday: 5PM - Later: Ha{ck}y Hours`

`Weekends: Nothing`

Extras: We are going to try to do 30min sessions in the evenings where we will code in Svelte. We may or may not keep this up for the whole month. We want to, but who knows. We will announce the times when we have confirmed.

**Welcome Token Kit**

Each participant, or team, provided a wallet address to us in their signup. Assuming you address was a Secret Network address and accurate, you will have already received various amounts of 10 tokens that we minted for you. They are named after 90's Skateboard Companies: _**Plan B, Girl, Blind, New Deal, Birdhouse, Powell, Toy Machine, Alien Workshop, Chocolate, and Zoo York.**_ These, along with the classic _**sSCRT**_, will be the tokens that are required for your auction app. On the next page __ we will walk you through adding them to Keplr.

If you haven't received the tokens, (your balance is 0 after you add them), or think you may have given us a non-Secret Network address, reach out to one of the admins on discord and we will get you setup.

**Youtube Channel**

Live Coding sessions will take place on our new Youtube Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHl03HGzmkDI7L8zoLoWWw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHl03HGzmkDI7L8zoLoWWw). In addition, we will be posting bite size videos as we think to record them.&#x20;

**Discord for everything else**

Everything else will be happening on Discord. Feel free to reach out to any of us over there.

**Onward**

Once again, we are incredibly grateful that you have chosen to participate. We hope this is a rewarding and enlightening experience.

_Sincerely_

_The Griptape Team_
