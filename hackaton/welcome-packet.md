# Welcome Packet

Welcome Hackers

We are excited to welcome you all to the first Griptape Hackathon. This is a big milestone for us, one that we are thrilled to share with you. So, without further ado, we have begun.

Schedule

The hackathon is broken into four weeks. Each week will follow the same schedule

Monday: You Do You

Tuesday: 1PM-3PM: Live React Coding

Wed: 1PM - 3PM: Live Vue Coding

Thursday: 1PM - 3PM: Office Hours

Friday: 5PM - Later: Ha{ck}y Hours

Weekends: Nothing

Extras: We are going to try to do 30 min sessions in the evenings where we will code in Svelte. We may or may not keep this up for the whole month, we want to, but who knows

Welcome Token Kit

Each participant, or team, provided a wallet address to us in their signup. Assuming you address was a Secret Network address and accurate, you will have already received various amounts of 10 tokens that we minted for you. They are named after 1990's Skateboard Companies and are: Plan B, Girl, Blind, New Deal, Birdhouse, Powell, Toy Machine, Alien Workshop, Chocolate, and Zoo York. In getting setup we will walk you through adding them to Keplr.

If you haven't received these, or think you may have given us a none Secret Network address, reach out to one of the admins on discord and we will get you setup.

Youtube Channel

Live Coding sessions will take place on our new Youtube Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHl03HGzmkDI7L8zoLoWWw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHl03HGzmkDI7L8zoLoWWw). We are new to the whole streaming rigmarole so bare with us as we get our sea legs.

Discord for everything else

Everything else will be happening on Discord. Feel free to reach out to any of us over there.

Onward

We are again grateful to have you here, we hope this is a rewarding and enlightening experience.

Sincerely

The Griptape JS Team
