## Last Release Details

As you might know, this is the last two weeks of development for Griptape. It has been an awesome journey,
and we want to share with you some of the history of Griptape, the features you might expect for this last
release and a peek to the future: what other awesome tools we can provide to make Griptape **the**
blockchain development framework.

### History about how it started

Griptape started as a simple approach to bring to life one of our first applications in Secret Network: **Secret Auctions**.
It was a base architecture and a set of helper functions that enables us to form a foundation in which then we were
able to rapidly build all the different components of the application.

By the time we finished Secret Auctions, more and more opportunities came to us to develop new applications. For sure,
we didn't want to build all the foundation code again, but at the same time it was hard to refactor and difficult to
decouple from the domain of that application. So, we put some effort into separate and make that code generic, in order
to had the ability to rapidly bootstrap and code.

As part of that, we found a lot of patterns over the time we build new applications. Those patterns end up with
what we know today as Griptape. It is all the knowledge we have aquired during the time we have developed in this
ecosystem.

### Griptape.js

Now that we are weeks away from the first major milestone for Griptape, this is what the current state looks like.
